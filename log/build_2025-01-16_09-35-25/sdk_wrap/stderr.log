[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findseekcamera.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "seekcamera", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "seekcamera" with
  any of the following names:

    seekcameraConfig.cmake
    seekcamera-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "seekcamera" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "seekcamera_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "seekcamera" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
